# 🍳Recipe Preparation AI Agent

**Recipe Preparation AI Agent** is an AI-powered assistant that helps users cook delicious meals using only the ingredients they already have at home. Built using **IBM Watsonx.ai** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, the agent suggests personalized recipes, step-by-step cooking instructions, and ingredient substitutions — making daily cooking smarter, easier, and more sustainable.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many people struggle to figure out what to cook with limited ingredients at home. Searching online often requires exact ingredients, wasting time and food. There's a need for a smart, context-aware cooking assistant that can turn what's available into practical meals.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

CookSmart uses IBM Watsonx.ai and a vector index to understand user-provided ingredients and recommend suitable recipes. The agent retrieves relevant recipes from a local database, generates instructions, suggests substitutions, and offers dietary guidance using generative AI.
